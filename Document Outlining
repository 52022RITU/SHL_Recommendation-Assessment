This project presents a semantic recommendation system that suggests the most relevant SHL assessments based on a given job description or query. 
Built using FastAPI and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, the application accepts free-text input and returns a curated list of up to 10 SHL assessments, 
each enriched with details such as duration, test type, remote testing compatibility, and adaptive support. 
The system leverages precomputed sentence embeddings generated by the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from sentence-transformers, comparing them to the user query using cosine similarity for ranking.
OpenAI's language model is integrated via langchain-openai to enhance the reasoning pipeline. 
The backend exposes clear REST endpoints (/health and /recommend) and includes interactive API documentation.
All code, data preprocessing, and deployment infrastructure (Docker, Hugging Face, GitHub) are publicly available. 
Future enhancements may include LLM-based re-ranking, advanced filtering by test category or duration, and multilingual support to improve global accessibility.
